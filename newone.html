        <h1>Tour of HTML</h1>
        <p> 
        P is for paragraph. Long text goes in here.
        We can nest elements. Here is an "anchor"(a tag):
        <a href="http://www.google.com">My link:<a>
        href on an "a" tage is our first attribute.
        </p>
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>We have 3 types of liste: ordered, unordered, and select lists. Select 
            is a little different 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Here is the first item</li>
            <li>Here s the second</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>This is a list item</li>
            <li>Here is another</li>
        </ul>
        <select>
        <option>opt1</option>
        <option>opt2</option>
        <option>opt3</option>
        </select>

<h3>Tables</h3>
<p>
    Tables in html consists of a number of nested tags: 
    We'll need: table, thead, body,tr(row), th(for row heading), 
    and td(data cell)
</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
    <th>col1</th>
    <th>col2</th>
    <th>col3</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Data 1</td>
<td>Data 2</td>
<td>Data 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Data 4</td>
    <td>Data 5</td>
    <td>Data 6</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>
    div and span elements
</h3>
<p>div is a divsion, a section of your page. It has no meaming and no defualt style.</p>
<br>
<p>span is similarly meaningless, but it is has "inline" tyle instead of "block" style.</p>


<div>
    <p>
        this p tag is inside a div, not that we could tell. The div just organizes out page, 
        seperating it out into sections.
        <span>This text is inside a span element, inside the p element</span>
    </p>
</div>
<h5>Inline vs block</h5>
<p>Block elemnents "own their own vertical space.They take up a hroizontal band
    across the screen. Tables, h16s, p tags, div tags, are all block elements.
    <br>
    Inline elements don't own their own vertical space -- they make use of
    the space controlled by their parent element. A tages and span tags are inline
    elements.
    <br>
    the above is defualt behavior  -- we can change it with styling.
</p>
<p>
    We can also say tha div is the generic block element and span is the 
    generic inline element
, they can be used to mark text for decoreation. 
<em>Emphasize with,</em>,
<u>underlined, but don't use this (see MDN). Deprecated .,</u>,<strong>
    Strong for something bol-like, does'nt have to be bold
</strong>. </p>

<h5>Typical use of div and span</h5>
<p>are generic, we typically assign them class(es)
    attributes to specify their meaning and style. To some extent, div has been replaced 
    with semantic tags in html</p>P>
<h3>Semantic Tags (new in HTML5</h3>

<p>Semantic tags were built with the intent od replacing many divs your semantichave no defialt
    style and represent structure, but each has a name with a meaning.

</p>

<header> This is in a header</header>
<nav>This is a nav</nav>
<section>This is in a section</section>
<footer>This is in a footer</footer>

<p>
    These make your HTML more sensible. Better for developers and they partially replace ARIA(Acessible Rich Internet Application)
    labels for accesinility.
</p>

<h3>images</h3>
<p>
    Images are used with the img tag.
    We specify a src, a title, and alt for alternative text
</p>
<img src=""
>

<h3>New Html5 media tags</h3>
<p>
    HTML5 added native support audio, video, and canvas. Canvas supports SVGs; it's the native replacement
    for FLASH
</p>
<canvas></canvas>
<video></video>
<audio></audio>

<h3>Forms</h3>
<p>
    forms are the html way of having users interact with your server. They
    enable HTTP GET the HTTP POST requests without and Javascript.
</p>

<form method="GET" action="mybrokensite.com">
    <label>
        Text Input
    <input type="text" name="texti">
    </label>

        <input type="text" name="q">
        <input type="submit">
    </form>
